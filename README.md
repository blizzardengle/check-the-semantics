# check-the-semantics

A simple script that traverses the DOM tree of a web page and reports the statics of HTML semantic elements being used. My inspiration for this is I got really bored and procrastinated doing homework for my Masters program.

Feel free to contribute! If you ever get bored and want to procrastinate too, lets see what other stats we can gather.

## Run Script

Visit any page you would like to view stats for, open the dev console, paste the code from `show-semantics.js` into the console, and press `enter`. An HTML table will be appended to the top of the page.

**NO WARRANTY:** Use this code, including copy-pasting, at your own risk. Always understand what your doing online especially when copy-pasting unknown code.

## Update Script

If new semantic elements are created or moved to the depreciated list you will need to update the `semantics` variable in `show-semantics.js`/. This can be done with the `update-semantics.js` file; see file for instructions.
